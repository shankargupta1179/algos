This algorithm is one of the pattern matching algorithms where text n is given and also a pattern m is given to match 
We can define a hash function and find the hash value of the pattern and check the hash value for the pattern length in text n and we only go through the text if and only if 
the hash value of the pattern and the text of size equal to pattern matches
if the hash value does not match we are going to slide the window in the text n 


The worst case time complexity is O(n*m) where n is the length of text and m is the length of pattern
The average case time complexity is O(n-m+1) 

Remember that taking a simple hash function can result in more number of spurious hits(i.e matching hash values) which results in more complexity

So , hash function needs to be little complex
