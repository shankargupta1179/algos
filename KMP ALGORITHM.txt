This is one of the efficient string matching algorithms , it helps to remove the redundant work we do in the naive string matching code by storing longest prefix suffix(lps) array
The worst case time complexity to find the pattern matching is o(n+m) where n is the length of given string and m is the length of pattern that we need to find whether it is 
present in the above given string or not
